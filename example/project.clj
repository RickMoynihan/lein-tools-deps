  ;; Dependencies provided by deps.edn are merged with any found in
  ;; your configured leiningen profile. Normally we'd recommend you
  ;; remove as many dependencies as possible from your :dependencies
  ;; vector, unless you want them to be specific to your leiningen
  ;; environment. We include this sole dependency here to demonstrate
  ;; how deps.edn dependencies are combined with those in leiningen.
  :dependencies [[clj-time "0.14.4"]]

  ;; Here we show how top level configurations can be merged with
  ;; configurations in profiles.

  ;; The default project will include :deps along with :extra-deps

  ;; You can configure lein-tools-deps to :resolve-aliases defined in
  ;; your deps.edn file.  You can do this, as demonstrated here,
  ;; by mapping groups of aliases into leiningen profiles.
  ;;
  ;; The active :profiles configuration are meta-merged together
  ;; before tools.deps resolution, and the combined set
  ;; of :resolve-aliases are given to tools.deps for it to resolve.
  ;;
  ;; So the :cache profile below will resolve-aliases for [:async :cache].
